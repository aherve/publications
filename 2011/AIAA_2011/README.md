## Abstract:
This paper aims to suppress unsteadiness in a convectively unstable flow configuration. System identification methods will be used to design a controller. Unlike classical Galerkin-based methods, no knowledge about the dynamics or about the incoming perturbations is required, as the whole process relies only on data that one could extract from a lab experiment, hence le ading to a methodology that is suitable for experimental control. The numerical control of a 2D-backward facing step will be achieved to illustrate the process.

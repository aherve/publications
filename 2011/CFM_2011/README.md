## Abstract:
This paper aims to suppress unsteadiness in a convectively unstable ﬂow conﬁguration, using a linear-quadratic-gaussian (LQG) compensator. To model the ﬂow dynamics, an data-based system-identiﬁcation technique is used for the estimator, whereas a classical LQG framework will be used to derive the compensator; Physical insight into the speciﬁcs of the ﬂow is used to tailor the various terms of an ARMAX model. Due to its reliance on only time-sequences of observable data, the proposed technique should be attractive in the design of control strategies directly from experimental data.

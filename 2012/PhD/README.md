## Abstract:
This work aims at defining a low order modeling framework, in order to perform flow
control. Two different flow configurations are introduced, that respectively represent a
typical case of an amplifier flow and an oscillator flow. For both flows, system identification
techniques along with a physical study of the flow are used in order to define a low order
model that is suited for control purposes. An efficient closed loop control system is then
built, and used to suppress the flow unsteadiness.
